<h1>Love yourself , as you have every right to be loved</h1>


<h2>Hey friends,

Before starting I had been wondering what do I write about, what is it that will enable me to connect to you guys more easily..There were so many things that had come to my mind when I started writing this, and trust me this present line could have been a far more different one had I not erased the ones I wrote earlier out of the confusion that what is it that I truly want to share. I opted for several things, since I just love to read and now a days with the inspration and encouragement of my husband I have considered to give it a thought to write something of my own , I was thinking that I may start with publish the parts I have written as episodes or chapters and the response will help me go forward, but then I thought why will anyone read those , when no one even knows about me. 

I thought a lot , then ultimately something struck me. In daily life , in whatever work we involve ourselves with , whatever we do , we are so busy , we hardly find time to look at ourselves or to pay attention to the little needs that we have or also eben though we are aware what thos nees are we do not have anyone to listen to those. This is something everyone of us faces in daily life. People are smarter and busier now a days, so they find a way out to overcome this wantings, but why avoid , why not come out loud and speak if the every single thing that is coming in our mind and or the very simple issue that is bothering you at present. Sometimes by just speaking our heart out gives a solution of your problems , makes you life easier. I will be here to hear you out. 

Little about myself by making it easier to relate to me:

I am a 28 years married IT professional staying at Bangalore, who like evry other IT engineer has the regular schedule of having no time limit of work , sometimes I spend the whole day working and working, in rare days I try to elevate my mood by cooking something out of the way for me and my husband provided the work pressure that time is low. As whole I have a boring life , but as a person I don't see my self boring, I love travalling although , the graph has gone down hill and I have not been to anywhere for the last few months but am planning to have one in the coming month  . My husband is alo working in oine of the IT giants, and he needs to work almost 18 hours a day to finish his work, and there are times we do not even get time to talk to each other apart from dinner time. I have been a book worm since my childhood days , and I being so passionate about reading books , this habit did not leave me. Some how after joining my first company as a graduate hire , in order to survive and make a fruitful position there , I almost forgot what all passions I had , or what was I good at. But after coming to Bangalore, I somehow again felt the need to engross my self in something I really loved to do , to supress the feeling of being lonely at times and thus I started to read again and even started to write a story .
